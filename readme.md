Ramadhan World App
The Ramadhan World App is a progressive web application (PWA) designed to be a daily companion for Muslims, especially during the holy month of Ramadhan. It provides essential Islamic features such as prayer times, Qibla direction, Holy Quran recitation, Tasbeeh counter, and Islamic Naat collection.

Features
Prayer Times (Salah): Displays accurate prayer times based on your current location (GPS or IP-based). It also features a countdown to the next prayer and highlights the current prayer time.

Qibla Compass: Helps users find the direction of the Qibla (Kaaba in Mecca) using their device's compass, with real-time rotation.

Holy Quran Recitation: Offers a comprehensive list of all 114 Surahs of the Holy Quran. Users can select any Surah to listen to its recitation and view its Arabic text along with English translation.

Tasbeeh Counter: A simple digital counter to help users keep track of their Dhikr (remembrance of Allah). The count persists even if the app is closed.

Naat Collection: Features a collection of Islamic Naats (devotional poetry) playable via an embedded YouTube playlist.

Ramadhan World Radio: A 24/7 live Islamic radio stream featuring Quran recitations, naats, duas, and Islamic talks.

Azan Notifications: Allows users to receive notifications for prayer times.

PWA (Progressive Web App): Can be installed on mobile devices for a native app-like experience, including offline capabilities and home screen access.
